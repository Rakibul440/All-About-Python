In Python, data types can be classified into two main categories: immutable and mutable.

## Immutable Data Types:

Immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created. Any attempt to modify them will result in a new object being created.

Examples of immutable data types in Python:

1. Integers (int)
2. Floats (float)
3. Strings (str)
4. Tuples (tuple)
5. Boolean (bool)
6. Complex numbers (complex)
7. Bytes (bytes)

## Mutable Data Types:

Mutable data types can be changed after they are created. Modifications can be made in-place, without creating a new object.

Examples of mutable data types in Python:

1. Lists (list)
2. Dictionaries (dict)
3. Sets (set)
4. User-defined classes (class)
5. Arrays (array)
6. Bytearrays (bytearray)

## Key differences:

1. Assignment: Immutable objects cannot be changed after assignment, while mutable objects can.
2. Memory allocation: Immutable objects are allocated memory only once, while mutable objects may have their memory reallocated.
3. Performance: Immutable objects are generally faster, as they don't require memory reallocation.

## Best practices:

1. Use immutable data types for data that shouldn't change, like constants or configuration settings.
2. Use mutable data types for data that needs to change, like user input or dynamic data structures.

## Example:


## Immutable string

```
s = "Hello"
print(id(s))  ## prints memory address
s += " World"
print(id(s))  ## prints different memory address
```

## Mutable list

```
l = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(l))  ## prints memory address
l.append(4)
print(id(l))  ## prints same memory address
```
