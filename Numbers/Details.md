# Numbers
In Python, numbers are a fundamental data type. Here's an overview:

## Types of Numbers:

1. Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.
2. Floating-Point Numbers (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, etc.
3. Complex Numbers (complex): Numbers with real and imaginary parts, e.g., 3+4j, 2-3j, etc.

## Number Literals:

- Integers: 123, 0x7b (hexadecimal), 0o123 (octal), 0b1010 (binary)
- Floating-Point Numbers: 123.45, 1.23e-4 (scientific notation)
- Complex Numbers: 3+4j, 2-3j

## Number Operations:

- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, ** (exponentiation)
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Logical operators: and, or, not
- Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

## Number Functions:

- abs(): Absolute value
- round(): Round to nearest integer
- pow(): Exponentiation
- max(), min(): Find maximum/minimum value
- sum(): Calculate sum of a list of numbers

## Special Numbers:

- inf: Positive infinity
- -inf: Negative infinity
- nan: Not a number (result of undefined operations)

## Number Representation:

- Integers: Stored as C long integers
- Floating-Point Numbers: Stored as C doubles
- Complex Numbers: Stored as pairs of C doubles
